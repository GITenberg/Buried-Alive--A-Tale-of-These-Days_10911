description: Need a good laugh? Immerse yourself in this delightfully dark tale from
  Arnold Bennett. Buried Alive recounts the trials and triumphs of one Priam Farll,
  a world-famous artist who is deeply uncomfortable with his own fame and whose crippling
  shyness makes it difficult to navigate. Fed up with his unsatisfying existence,
  Priam comes up with a highly unusual solution. Will he be able to pull off this
  far-fetched scheme?
